# Flex Workshop Overview 
## Under Development

- This wiki provides a collection of labs to help you getting started with Flex. 

- Note that Flex can also be deployed as a Lambda or within containerized environments such as Kubernetes,  ECS Fargate, ECS EC2, Docker Swarm etc. 

- These labs currently:
    - Go through a standard host install as well as Kubernetes.
    - Demonstrate usage with the New Relic Infrastructure Agent, however note that you can also run Flex standalone in Insights mode.
